# Evaluating the Efficacy of Several Machine Learning Algorithms on Enhancers Annotation

## Description
This repository is part of my MSc Bioinformatics thesis project, supervised by Radu Zabet, focusing on evaluating the efficacy of various machine learning algorithms for the annotation of genetic enhancers. The study compares algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost across different feature sets and datasets.
